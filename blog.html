    <h1>Heyy !! This is my blog </h1>
    <p>
        <span>Welcome to IT industry !!</span>
        One of the most significant factors that have helped India make its mark on the world map is its booming IT
        industrial sector. The contributions being made by the IT industry towards the country's GDP has led to the
        steady growth of the Indian economy. India's IT industry is regarded as a hub of innovators providing
        world-class technology solutions across the globe. Various international organizations have set up their offices
        here in India like Google, Accenture and others. It has helped in changing the Indian economy from an
        agricultural-based economy to a knowledge-driven economy.
        <br>
        The IT sector has helped the domestic economy to integrate with the world economy. It has made significant
        impacts on the lives of many people. It has also helped people settled in far-flung topographies to connect with
        the rest of the world. It has given birth to e-governance practices, as a result of which people get easy access
        via e-health, e-education, e-ticketing etc., to the various governmental services.

        Now, almost everything can be done online whether it's shopping, ticketing, filing Income Tax returns etc.
        Though 2014 and 2020 were full of challenges and uncertainties, the IT sector managed to achieve a double-digit
        growth rate and attained revenues of USD 108 billion in the fiscal yearThe industry amounted to 8% of India’s
        GDP and registered 138,000 new hires in 2020.

        Its timely transition to remote working environments assisted in maintaining the industry’s growth amid
        coronavirus pandemics. Indian software product industry is anticipated to reach US$ 100 billion or contribute
        10% to the nation GDP by 2025.

        <span>Government initiatives</span>
        After the economic reforms that were introduced in the state and central the government provided various
        incentives for better emergence of the IT sector like liberalization of external trade, removing duties on
        imports of IT products, setting up Export Oriented Units(EOU), setting up of Software Technical Parks(STP) etc.

        The Government of India has also set up a National Task Force on IT and Software development to investigate the
        possibility of strengthening the economy.
